        <h1>What Graphs Says .?</h1>
        <p>Covid-19 is a fast pace disease, Meaning in a its <a style="color:black;font-weight: bold;" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Period in which he is infected but do not show any symptoms">incubation period</a> the person does not know he is infected and continue to
          spread the infection among the people he meets. As in our case here if people does not do anything to prevent it, in no time more and more people will
          get infected. Its rise is exponential and soon the limited medical resouces gets occupied and no more infected people gets treated for the disease.
          This leads to increase in number of deaths as shown in the simulation</p>
        <ul>
          <li><p>In scene 1 people are careless and do not do anything for prevention therefore its a dead end for the society, Similar scenario was in Italy when the pandemic was started.</p></li>
          <li><p>In scene 2 people Tends to take Corona seriously and washed hand regularly and uses sanitizers, this may lower the risk of getting infected but it not enough to stop the exponential rise in the infected people.</p></li>
          <li><p>In scene 3 Government emposes strict Lockdowns, these lockdowns are hard to implement and ofter depends upon the people to make them successfull. Similar lockdowns are adopted by many countries to decrease the spread rate.</p></li>
          <li><p>In scene 4 There is no lockdown but social distancing is the factor playing along which leads to less and less interaction with the infected ones and this turns out to be very effective as simlations shows.</p></li>

      <h1>What The Issue .?</h1>
      <p>Covid-19 has a incubation period of around 14 days i.e. if you are infected you won't come to know until the next 14 days which is a very dangerous thing, as you may feel you are 
        healthy but you will be infected the rest of the people around you for the rest of the 14 days, Who will also infect another people unknowingly and those people will infect anothers ones leading to 
        growth in infected people exponentialy
      </p>
      <p>As we have learned Covid-19 is a fast pace disease and it leads to exponential rise in infected persons and these people runs to the hospitals for medical care
        but as Each Country only has <span style="color:black;font-weight:bold">Limited Medical Resources</span>, it can't cope hike in the number of patients and many patients
        are left untreated, This increase the death rate and more and more people gets infected due to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        To overcome the growing rate of infected people we need to cut off going out and stay at home, You cant get infected by staying at home. Which leads to less problems for others. Therefore...
